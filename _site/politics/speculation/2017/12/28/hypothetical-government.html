    <p>Thinking a bit about what my fantasy form of government (I used to be a fan of direct democracy) nowadays would be, here it is:</p>

<p>Fundamentally based on US model,</p>

<p>Reduce the number of congresspeople down to either 12 or 14. Similarly with the senate. Keep the president and court system as is.</p>

<p>Instead of voting by geographic area, these representatives would have their constituents randomly (but evenly) distributed throughout the entire country. So if you live with your spouse, you might be represented by senator 1, but they could be represented by senator 3. The only difference (in terms of elections) between congress and the senate would be term limits. Thus the highest level of government is incentivized only to act in the collective good, and has a much greater degree of accountability and ownership.</p>

<p>Accountability and ownership brings us to lower levels of government: state and city. I would try replacing democratically elected committees at both levels with democratically elected “tyrants”. Tyrants could be re elected over and over again ad infinitum, and would have all the authority currently invested in state/city legislative/executive bodies.</p>

<p>A branch of the federal bureaucracy would oversee all elections. Furthermore, another branch (of the federal bureaucracy) would be responsible for continuously polling the levels of satisfaction constituents had for their tyrants. Falling below a certain percentage, say 25% approval, would trigger an automatic re election for the tyrants position.</p>

<p>Seeing the difference in behavior, and “level of sophistication” between the chinese politburo and us congress partially inspired this line of thought (I think there are real problems with the chinese system though, though I must also admit it seems a bit opaque in operation to me (e.g. [3 ups 3 downs wtf?]: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_China]), from what I can tell higher levels of government ultimately determine who is nominated to run for lower levels, which seems like a horrible idea to me).</p>

<p>Ironically I think the system of tyrants would lead to an aversion to the kinds of political radicals that make for appealing representatives under the current system, which is all about bargaining power in committee. A tyrant would also be able to design much more cohesive policy than a committee, and actually, legitimately, experiment and measure the results and reverse course if it doesn’t work out, something almost impossible in the current system since you have to brainwash your followers into a morality play every time you want to get something done. Initially there might be some bad outcomes, but good outcomes would replicate while bad ones died out.</p>

<p>Similarly, smaller committee = more accountable and more ownership. Anything over 20ish starts to sort of turn on this undesirable mob behavior.</p>

<p>Lastly you might say, this decreases representation. I talked to my parents and they could not even NAME their representative in the state house of reps. A name is far from familiarity. Similarly they voiced the opinion that all that mattered was the political party of their representative… A bit of teaching to the test phenomena, doomed to result in bad outcomes. If the state was run by a tyrant everyone would know them and the policy decisions associated with them, everyone would have a more subtle opinion than just, “he’s a republican so we voted for him”. Similarly for everyone else in the proposed system - in this way the system would actually INCREASE the extent to which the electorate was represented by their government, by getting rid of this sort of paradox of choice.</p>

<p>Along with those changes, I would also, sort of, eliminate capital cities. Gathering all the federal reps in one place would be too much of a liability. Congress/senate would act more like a distributed corporation e.g. automattic (people behind wordpress). Most federal communication would be done over asynchronous, recordable channels, and while I’m fantasizing, bills would be drafted using git as source control and hosted on github to see how the bills changed over time and what was considered XD.</p>

<p>There are also probably quite a few details I haven’t thought through, or I’m not sure on the optimal approach, e.g. who gets to be on the ballot in the election of tyrants.</p>

<p>One change I would make to the court system is to give people the option to opt into receiving a random verdict, or semi random computer generated verdict, in some cases. I think this could potentially increase efficiency whilst maintaining the same level of “justice” for some legal issues. I haven’t looked into this too deeply however.</p>

<p>Also you could probably use some kind of block chain combined with rsa public key cryptography to run your geographically distributed election (maybe just distribute something like a yubi key to everyone once a year or something) and then in a separate process, poll people on how they voted to detect if a hack might have occurred.</p>

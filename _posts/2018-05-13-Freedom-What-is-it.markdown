Freedom means different things to different people - but in this essay I'll try to provide a definition that seems more significant to me than most others I've come across, because of it's interesting properties.

1. in this definition of freedom, it's an inherit property of pretty much everything in the universe, and not just self aware things
2. in this definition of freedom, freedom is completely orthogonal or unrelated to the issue of free will
3. despite 1 and 2 this definition of freedom can serve as a [moral inference rule between is statements and ought statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isâ€“ought_problem). Moreover, it seems to be a particularly good and universal/abstract moral inference rule.

### Thinking about an example

Let's start from the perspective of a person. To keep things concrete and thus simple, let's imagine the person is stuck in a giant cage with a single green colored button. Additionally they are kept alive by food delivered by anonymous jailers in the form of pills and given a water drip to drink from and a toilet in the corner.

How much freedom does this person have? Probably not much right? Actually even in this simple scenario it's hard to say - they might have a lot of mental freedom if they have an active imagination or a large body of memorized knowledge, or almost none if they are mentally extremely compulsive. But physically, they have about as little freedom as is possible for a human to have. That dichotomy between mental and physical is important but not at all unique, and we'll see it again later.

What if they are then given another button? What if they are given one hundred new buttons to press, all in different colors? How much is their freedom increased?

Even if a thousand new buttons of different colors are placed into the cage, these "choices" do not provide very much freedom. High quality choices have several properties that these do not.

For one thing, nested choice, being able to choose what choices you make, is higher "quality" choice than non-nested choice. Choices that are more "meta" provide more freedom. 

Freedom also implies that the sequences of choices people are
presented with are not a closed loop (or if they are, longer loops provide more freedom than shorter ones). Choices that have higher or infinite "cyclicity" provide more freedom.

The last property of choices that produce freedom, is that they are more "distinctive". Consider the distinction between mental choice and physical choice. Those two kinds of choices can be paired with each other simultaneously to result in new choice combinations (e.g. jog, sit, dance; beethoven, mozart, rachmaninov = jog while humming beethoven, sit while humming beethoven, dance while humming beethoven, jog while humming mozart, ... etc.). So if we gave someone 10 mental choices and 11 physical choices it might result in 10 X 11 = 110 effective different choice combinations. Whereas if we gave someone 100 mental choices and 1 physical choice, that might only result in 100 choice combinations, that's less possible choice combinations even though we gave them more choices! (you might be able to combine physical choices as well, [but it's less likely](http://mlspe.blogspot.com/p/brain-gym-activities.html); some physical choices are more distinctive/combinable than others)

If we had three choice categories and gave the person 10 choices in each, that might result in 1000 choice combinations even though we only gave them 30 choices. So if we go back to the person in the cage, giving them the option to leave the cage would be a particularly distinctive choice - being outside or inside the cage would be like a new choice category.

Moreover, distinctive choices can interact with one another in other ways aside from merely forming more combinations between themselves, for example if you have physical freedom to read a book that can give you mental freedom; if you have the mental freedom to think about knots you may come up with a new way to tie your shoes.

So in the cage example, if the person had an extremely compulsive mind obsessed with pressing buttons, giving them more buttons might give them more freedom than opening up the cage - but for most people; who are capable of doing or imagining a very large number of things (definitely over 10,000 distinct things), opening up the cage would provide a lot more possibilities than even coating the walls in buttons.

### Freedom as a moral inference rule

So the moral inference rule is that we should make choices that lead to more freedom.

At first glance, you might spot several potential problems:
1. the inference rule doesn't tell us whether or not we should value our own freedom over others, or whether some people's freedom is more important than others
2. the inference rule doesn't tell us why we should value human freedom over animal freedom or even the freedom of nonliving things
3. the inference rule doesn't tell us directly why we should use a moral inference rule to make decisions

Here's some responses:

1. If we restrict others freedom eventually we end up hurting ourselves because we interact with those people and if they as free agents have less choices there are many less possible interactions between us and them. 

Moreover, a pure utilitarian concern for increasing freedom in general, when applied by an individual wouldn't necessarily lead to an irrationally selfless philosophy - because people know themselves best.

societies imposing freedom on people who don't want it (compulsive button pressers)
but this has an escape hatch: if society forbids everyone from becoming compulsive button pressers, that is a large decrease in freedom, so unless button pressing becomes an unmanageably large compulsion
society should not intervene

2. We could restrict our inference rule only to apply to thinking entities; one potential definition of a thinking entitiy would be, any turing machine like entity with a certain amount of computational power and memory. This restriction could be justified since such entities are the (only?) ones capable of meta decisions; tranisitioning between states based in part on an external model of their current state.

3. It's true we can't justify our moral inference rule with itself but that might be because it's impossible to do so with any moral inference rule. On top of that, we all use moral inference rules anyway - informal ones - we all as a practical matter make choices, based on our perceptions of an underlying reality. By using freedom as our moral inference rule we can steadily eliminate inconsistencies in our higher level decision making and feel more in tune with ourselves. 

As a moral inference rule it has other attractive properties aside from the potential for greater consistency and harmony between our small and big, long and short term decisions.

As a moral inference rule, freedom has an inherent humility and flexibility in that it's difficulty to know which choices would lead to more freedom in the long term.

There is even some evidence of a "divine mandate" for this style of ethics - entropy [is a measurement of the number of microstates that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize a system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy), and the second law of thermodynamics says that entropy can only increase over time in any isolated system.

the difficulty of knowing whether or not you are actually increasing freedom corresponds with
historical/real world experience of knowing whether your're the good or bad guy, or if you're doing the right thing



TODO still some areas which might clash with moral intuition...

individuals trying to increase their own freedom and decreasing others in the process

how is this conception orthogonal from notion of freewill?
How does it beat deterministic argument that there's only an illusion of states and nothing really matters?
description of a room as a bunch of atoms or as a room which works better
vs. finite state machine being better description of what's actually happening than 
a simple path through states
